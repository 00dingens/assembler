Interrupt 13h  Disk I/O - access the disk drives (floppy and hard disk)
(0:004Ch)      does not try rereading disk if an error is returned


Function 02h    Read Sectors - read one or more sectors from diskette
entry   AH      02h
        AL      number of sectors to read
        BX      address of buffer (ES=segment)
        CH      track number (0-39 or 0-79 for floppies)
                (for hard disk, bits 8,9 in high bits of CL)
        CL      sector number (1 to 18, not value checked)
        DH      head number (0 or 1)
        DL      drive (0=A, 1=B, etc.) (bit 7=0)  (drive 0-7)
        ES:BX   address to store/fetch data  (buffer to fill)
       [0000:0078]  dword pointer to diskette parms
return  CF      clear (0) for successful
                set (1) failure
                AH      status (00h, 02h, 03h, 04h, 08h, 09h, 10h, 0Ah, 20h,
                        40h, 80h)
        AL      number of sectors transferred
note 1) Number of sectors begins with 1, not 0
     2) Trying to read zero sectors is considered a programming error; results
        are not defined
